# Logo and Name Usage Guidelines

Thank you for using the Birdhouse Framework. We are pleased that you've chosen our framework for your projects. To maintain the integrity of the Birdhouse Framework brand and to prevent any confusion or misrepresentation, we've established the following guidelines for using the Birdhouse Framework logo and name.

### Permitted Use

- **Project Attribution:** You may use the Birdhouse Framework logo and name to indicate that your project or product was built using the Birdhouse Framework. For example, in your project documentation or on your website, you may include statements like "Built with Birdhouse" together with the logo. You can also display the Birdhouse Framework logo with a note indicating your project's use of the framework.
- **Educational and Instructional Material:** You are welcome to use the logo and name in educational or instructional materials that teach or demonstrate how to use the Birdhouse Framework, such as tutorials, courses, or articles.

### Restrictions

- **No Implication of Affiliation or Endorsement:** The use of the Birdhouse Framework logo and name should not imply any official affiliation with or endorsement by the Birdhouse Framework team unless such a relationship has been formally established. Please avoid using the logo or name in a way that suggests sponsorship, partnership, or any official status without explicit permission.
- **Inappropriate Use:** You should not use the Birdhouse Framework logo or name in any way that is misleading, defamatory, infringes on intellectual property rights, violates any rights of privacy or publicity, or is otherwise unlawful or in any manner that disparages the Birdhouse Framework or its community.

### Visual and Verbal Representation

- **Maintain Original Design:** Do not alter, distort, or reconfigure the logo. It should be used as provided by the Birdhouse Framework, ensuring that its design integrity is preserved.

- **Color Modification:** You are permitted to modify the color of the logo to better align with your project's design aesthetic, provided there is sufficient contrast to maintain its visibility and recognizability. This flexibility is intended to facilitate the logo's integration into a variety of design contexts while respecting the Birdhouse Framework's brand identity.

- **Prohibited Uses:** The Birdhouse Framework logo should not be used in any manner that implies endorsement, affiliation, or sponsorship by the Birdhouse Framework unless such a relationship has been officially established. Additionally, the logo must not be used in contexts that could be considered inappropriate, offensive, or in conflict with the values and reputation of the Birdhouse Framework.
